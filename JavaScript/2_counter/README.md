## 2. Counter
In this project I have created a 'Counter' using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

There is a running count which is set to 0. Two buttons give the user options to either decrease or increase the count, and another allows the user to reset the count back to zero. The running count is displayed accordingly and changes color to match any changes.
