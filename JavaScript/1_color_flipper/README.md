## 1. Color Flipper

In this project I have created a 'Color Flipper' using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### There are two webpages:
#### 1. The 'Simple' page
This page serves as the homepage. When the button is clicked the background color of the document will change to a randomly selected color from a set array of colors. 
#### 2. The 'Hex' page
When the button is clicked the background color of the document will change to a randomly generated color from an array of letters and numbers.
